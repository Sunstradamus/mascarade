PROJECT CHECKPOINT README:

What is working:
  - Original art assets (maybe one more fancy background)
  - Game server can run a game as long as you don't claim any action cards
  - Game coordinator can get you into a lobby
  - Front end template is done (game.html)

What is in progress:
  - Front end reactjs code
  - Proper login/lobby pages
  - Last pieces of game server (claiming actions)

Premade accounts:
  - testuser:password

Notes:
  - In dev mode/fake lobby mode, all bets are off and the game may function oddly. Things like turn constraints and targetting constraints are disabled and may send the server into a weird state. This mode is provided to quickly test some cards against dummy targets.
