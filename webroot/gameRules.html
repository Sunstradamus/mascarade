        <h3>How to play Mascarade</h3>
        <p>
          Mascarade is a very simple game to pick up and play, with only a couple options each turn, but
          every game feels completely different. Unlike most traditional card games, you aren't allowed
          to look at your card, except under certain circumstances. Turns progress like most games, with
          each person getting their turn in order in a circle, until the conditions for a game to end are met
        </p>
        <p>
          On your turn you may do one of four actions. Note that when a game starts, the only two actions
          allowed for the first 4 turns are <b>Swap</b> and <b>Fake</b>. Once a player reaches 13 gold, or
          any player drops to 0 gold, the player with the most gold wins the game (there can be ties!).
        </p>
        <h3>Actions</h3>
        <div class="row">
          <img class= "col-sm-5 action-explain" src="/images/zipboys/swap.png" />
          <p class="col-sm-7">Switch your card with another player</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <img class= "col-sm-5 action-explain" src="/images/zipboys/fake.png" />
          <p class="col-sm-7">Fake a switch with another player. To all other players (including your target) this will look idential to a regular swap</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <img class= "col-sm-5 action-explain" src="/images/zipboys/check.png" />
          <p class="col-sm-7">Look at your own card. Other players will know you've done this, and it uses up your turn. Just don't be surprised if someone swaps you right afterwards!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">  
          <img class= "col-sm-5 action-explain" src="/images/zipboys/claim.png" />
          <p class="col-sm-7">
          Claim a character's ability. When you do this, every other player is given the opportunity to contest
          your claim. If anyone contests, you and all of the players who contested must reveal your cards. Whoever
          has the card that was claimed gets to do that action, even if it wasn't their turn! Also note that if
          nobody successfully reveals the card that was claimed, nobody gets to take that action. If anyone contests,
          everyone who reveals their card but does not win the contest must pay 1 gold to the
          courthouse. Here are the different effects of the characters in the game (note that a specific subset of cards
          is used depending on how many players are in the game)
